# ZCC - Frontend

- Runs on localhost:3000

### Required Dependencies:

- React.js
- Material-UI
- React icons
- Axios

### Install dependencies

- npm install

### How to start

- npm start

### How to run unit tests

- npm test
- I was having some trouble writing tests for React. I tried using testing-library/react and enzyme and was able to write basic tests for simple components, but my tests were not working once HTML components started being nested. It also became more complicated since I used Material-UI for most of my styling and I wasn't sure how to target those elements since they start off as React components and are converted to HTML elements.

### Additional Information

- ZCC - Backend needs to be running on localhost:5000 while ZCC - Frontend needs to be running on localhost:3000 in order to retrieve ticket data from Zendesk API

### Design Choices

- I chose to work with React, Node, and Express because I have experience using these technologies and am fairly competent with React.

- I decided to fetch all tickets in one request to save on API requests. Since I was using React on the frontend to display the tickets, it made it easier and quicker to toggle between different pages with pagination since all data had already been fixed. I could dynamically render different data on different "pages" much quicker with all the data loaded initially, than making a separate API request for each page. If there was significantly more data and it was more intensive to load all the data at once, I might have split it up into separate API requests. I'm also using a Node/Express server to initially fetch all the data from the Zendesk API, so I could see it being slow and bogged down more frequently with separate requests since the Node server is a middleman between the client and API. If React was fetching the data directly, I might have considered splitting it up into separate API requests.

- I opted to only show 10 tickets at a time in the UI and paginate when there's more than 10 tickets, because on my screen, it didn't look great with more than 10 tickets. 25 tickets would require a lot of scrolling and I didn't think an experience involving a lot of scrolling would have been as nice on smaller screens.
